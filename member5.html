          <h2>The Hidden Cost of Progress: Health Hazards Faced by Working-Class Women</h2>
          <p>The Industrial Revolution was a turning point in European history, reshaping economies and restructuring laborers. But for the majority of working-class women, factory life meant enormous physical risks that risked their health and well-being. Rather than realizing autonomy or mobility, the majority of women found themselves in situations that shattered their bodies and kept them from even gaining a minimum of health precautions. These risks were not incidental but structural consequences of capitalist growth and masculine relations to labor.</p>
          <p>The witness of the day provides a harrowing report of women's everyday misery. Elizabeth Bentley, who began life in the factories at the age of six, recalled working from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. with short intermissions. When asked about eating, she testified she often did not want to eat because it was so hot and dusty, and that "the overlooker took it, and gave it to the pigs."<sup id="ref1"><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup> Her evidence is indicative of a pathetic lack of regard for food and dignity in the workplace, where hunger and exhaustion were the norm. In the same way, recorded official factory visits revealed extensive respiratory illness in women workers who worked with textile dust and poor ventilation. Dr. James Mitchell, who was conducting inquiries into Manchester mills in 1833, noticed that young girls were "more affected than boys owing to their slender frame," and coughed up phlegm due to inhaling fibers day in and day out.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#note2">[2]</a></sup>
These facts are corroborated by scholarly studies. Stephen Nicholas and Deborah Oxley have analyzed wage records, height statistics, and nutritional measures in trying to assert that industrialisation didn't bring about evident gains for women's wellbeing. Infect, actually, they found. Factory girls ate less than their male counterparts and grew stunted and chronically undernourished.<sup id="ref3"><a href="#note3">[3]</a></sup> They show through evidence that women's health wasn't necessarily caused by poverty but was worsened by exploitative working conditions where cheap submissive women workers substituted bodily well-being and health.
</p>
          <p>This gendered abandonment had long-term consequences. Malnutrition and exhaustion in adolescence came to create work difficulties at birth, permanent damage to backs and joints, and vulnerability to epidemics. These women were the literal backbone of industrial expansion—but paid for it in silence. The neglect to protect female labor reflects a more deep-seated pattern of gendered inequality in industrial society. And this suffering was not without purpose. It assisted to fuel rising social awareness and eventually legislative reform, for instance, the Ten Hours Act of 1847, which began to limit women's and children's working hours. Therefore, women's health crises throughout industrialization not only shaped their own lives but contributed to set into motion humanitarían principles and public policy reform throughout modern Europe.</p>
