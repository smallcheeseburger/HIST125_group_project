          <h2>Class Differences: How Class Shaped Women’s Experiences in the Industrial Revolution</h2>
          <p>The Industrial Revolution transformed the lives of people across Europe, but its impact on women differed greatly depending on class. Women from different social backgrounds did not experience industrialization in the same way: working-class women became essential to the labor force; middle-class women were increasingly confined to domestic life; and upper-class women remained distant from industrial work, often supporting the very systems that caused hardship for women of lower classes.</p>
          <p>For working-class women, industrialization brought long hours of dangerous, exhausting work for very low wages. Factories and mines became crowded workplaces filled with women and children, often poorly ventilated, dirty, and unsafe conditions that harmed workers’ health.<sup id="ref1"><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup> Many working-class families relied on women’s wages for survival, leaving these women with little choice but to endure this difficult labor. Firsthand accounts like that of Isabel Wilson, a coal pit worker, reveal this reality clearly: she worked the night before giving birth and returned to work soon after, while caring for her children in poverty.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#note2">[2]</a></sup> These women’s labor was important to industrial production, however, they faced extreme physical environments and high rates of sickness and child death rate.
</p>
          <p>Middle-class women’s experiences were different. Many middle-class families believe that respectable women should stay at home, caring for children and managing the household. This “separate responsible” idea became a proof of family status and respectability. They are free from wage labor but it was not simply a cultural preference but a privilege made by the industrial economy’s dependence on working-class women’s hard labor. The comfort of middle-class families was  partially supported by the physical suffering of poor women working in factories and mines.</p>
         <p>Upper-class women were even further from the labor than other classes.Although some of them join in charity that aimed at helping poor women and children, they often did it with an attitude of superiority and without questioning the unfair system that made poverty. Their efforts could reduce some individual suffering but left others suffering in the broader structures that created and maintained inequality<sup id="ref4"><a href="#note4">[4]</a></sup></p>
          <p>These differences shaped not only economic conditions but also how women lived across classes during this period. Industrialization did not erase class divisions; it deepened them. While working-class women faced the harsh realities of industrial labor, middle- and upper-class women remained protected from its hardships and benefited indirectly from the exploitation of poorer women. Understanding industrialization from this perspective shows how it helped sustain both gender and class inequalities. These unequal experiences also shaped women’s responses: many working-class women became leaders in demands for fair wages and safer conditions, while some middle- and upper-class women resisted reforms that might threaten their privileged positions.</p>
