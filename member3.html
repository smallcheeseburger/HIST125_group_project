          <h2>Factory work Hard conditions </h2>
          <p>During the Industrial Revolution, factory work became one of the main sources of employment for working-class women, but the conditions they faced were extremely harsh, dangerous, and deeply unfair. Women were drawn into factories such as textile mills and cotton factories where they worked long shifts of 12 to 16 hours a day, six days a week. Factory owners preferred hiring women because they could pay them significantly less than men and believed women were easier to control and less likely to protest or organize. The work was highly repetitive and physically demanding, often requiring women to operate fast-moving machines that had little to no safety protections. As a result, injuries like crushed fingers, broken bones, and even fatalities were common. Many women had no choice but to endure these harsh conditions due to economic necessity and the lack of other employment options.<sup id="ref1"><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup></p>
          <p>The physical environment of factories was unhealthy and unsafe. Textile mills were overcrowded, noisy, and poorly ventilated, with cotton dust in the air causing respiratory illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and “brown lung” disease. The noise of machinery led to hearing damage over time, and sanitation facilities were inadequate, increasing the spread of disease. Women were subjected to strict discipline and close supervision by male overseers who enforced harsh rules and punished minor mistakes or lateness, often through verbal abuse or fines. Sexual harassment was also a serious issue, but women had no formal ways to report it or receive protection. Working mothers faced additional hardships, as childcare was unavailable. Many had to bring their children into dangerous factory settings or leave them unattended at home, putting families at risk. Despite these hardships, women’s wages were essential for many families’ survival, providing them with a limited degree of financial independence.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#note2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
          <p>Beyond enduring exploitation, women increasingly became involved in movements for labor reform. Their shared experiences of injustice helped inspire participation in strikes and protests demanding safer working conditions, fair wages, and reasonable working hours. Women took part in early union activities and worked alongside reformers to raise awareness about factory abuses. Their testimonies in government investigations exposed the brutal realities of industrial labor, which helped prompt reforms such as the Factory Acts that gradually improved working conditions and limited working hours. These efforts also laid important groundwork for the later women’s rights movement by connecting labor struggles with gender equality campaigns. Ultimately, the experience of women in factories during the Industrial Revolution highlighted urgent social inequalities and helped push society toward significant legal and political change.<sup><a href="#note1">[1]</a>, <a href="#note2">[2]</a></sup>
